JOB APPLICATION PROJECT 
Application Architecture:
Controller Layer:

        Job Controller: Handles incoming HTTP requests related to "Job".
        Company Controller: Manages requests related to "Company".
        Review Controller: Deals with requests related to "Review".
Service Layer:

        Job Service: Contains business logic for "Job" operations.
        Company Service: Contains business logic for "Company" operations.
        Review Service: Contains business logic for "Review" operations.
Repository Layer:

        Job Repository: Interfaces with the database to perform CRUD operations for "Job".
        Company Repository: Interfaces with the database to perform CRUD operations for "Company".
        Review Repository: Interfaces with the database to perform CRUD operations for "Review".
Database:

A storage system where data related to Job, Company, and Review entities is persisted.
Browser:

Represents the client-side that sends HTTP requests to the application.
Server:

The server receives requests from the browser, processes them through the application's layers (Controller, Service, Repository), interacts with the database, and sends responses back to the browser.
Flow of Interaction:
The Browser sends HTTP requests to the Controller layer of the application.
Each controller (Job, Company, Review) directs the request to its corresponding Service.
The Service layer contains the business logic and processes the request, interacting with the Repository layer if necessary.
The Repository layer handles direct interactions with the Database to perform CRUD operations.
After processing, a response is sent back from the Server to the Browser.
This structure follows the common pattern of separating concerns into different layers, making the application more modular and maintainable.
